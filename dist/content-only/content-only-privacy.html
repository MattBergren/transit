            We recognize the privacy of your personal information is important. The purpose of this policy is to let you know how we handle the information collected through the use of this website.

          <p>
            This policy does not apply to information collected through other means such as by telephone or in person, although that information may be protected by other privacy policies. As used in this policy, terms such as "we" or "our" and "Company" refer to UnitedHealthcare and its current and future affiliated entities, including our parent company UnitedHealth Group.

          <p>
            "Cookies" are small text files that may be placed on your computer when you visit a website or click on a URL. Cookies may include "single-session cookies" which generally record information during only a single visit to a website and then are erased, and "persistent" cookies which are generally stored on a computer unless or until they are deleted or are set to expire.

          <p>
            You may disable cookies and similar items by adjusting your browser preferences at any time; however, this may limit your ability to take advantage of all the features on this website.

            You may also manage the use of "flash" technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website. Note that we do not currently respond to web browser "Do Not Track" signals that provide a method to opt out of the collection of information about online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services because, among other reasons, there is no common definition of such signals and no industry-accepted standards for how such signals should be interpreted.
          </p>

            We may also allow third party service providers to use cookies and other technologies to collect information and to track browsing activity over time and across third party websites such as web browsers used to read our websites, which websites are referring traffic or linking to our websites, and to deliver targeted advertisements to you. We do not control these third party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies.

            We may use analytics companies to gather information and aggregate data from our website visitors such as which pages are visited and how often they are visited, and to enable certain features on our websites. Information is captured using various technologies and may include cookies.

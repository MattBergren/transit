My bank may pay UnitedHealthcare Insurance Company the new charges from my bank account which may include up to $200.00 of current retroactive charges plus monthly premium amount.</p>
    <p> This authority remains in effect until UnitedHealthCare Insurance Company (UnitedHealthCare Insurance Company of New York for New York residents) or one of its affiliates and the named banking facility receives notification from me of its termination in such time and manner as to give UnitedHealthCare Insurance Company and the banking facility a reasonable opportunity to act on it. I have the right to stop payment of a withdrawal by notification to the named banking facility in such time as to give the banking facility a reasonable opportunity to act upon it, with the understanding that such action may put my plan account past due.

Your electronic signature is binding, just as if you had signed a paper form. Your consent to use your electronic signature applies only to this EFT form.

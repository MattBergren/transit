                    <p>To sign up for automatic deductions from your checking account, select the setup automatic payments in the Premium Payments overview section of this page. You can also download and complete the form below and follow the instructions provided. <a href="#">Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT ) Form (PDF)</a></p>



                    <h4>Automatic deduction from your credit/debit account</h4>

                    <p>To sign up for automatic deductions from your credit/debit card, select the setup automatic payments in the Premium Payments overview section of this page.</p>



                    <h4>Monthly Billing</h4>

                    <p>You may pay by mail each month (we will provide you a monthly bill). You may also make advance payments. If making a payment for the entire year, you will only need to submit one bill along with a check for the total premium amount due for the year.</p>

                    <h4>SSA Deduction</h4>

                    <p>Processing the SSA deduction is completed through the Social Security Administration and may take up to two or more months to begin. During that time, you will receive a monthly bill to make your payments. The first deduction from your Social Security benefit check will include all premiums due from the Social Security deduction effective date.

                    <a href="#">Social Security Deduction Form (PDF)</a></p>

                    <p>If you are receiving help from a plan sponsor (former employer, union or trust administrator) or State Pharmaceutical Assistance Program (SPAP) you have the right to elect automatic deductions from your Social Security benefit check.</p>



                    <p>However, it is important that you know that Social Security does not know if you have other coverage that pays part of your premium, even when the other coverage is paying part of your premium to your Medicare plan.</p>
